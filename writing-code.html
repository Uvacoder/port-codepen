          <h1>On writing code</h1>
          <p>I've been doing it since 2007. I mean, that's when I wrote down my first ever HTML, which was just a <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>. But I got remarkably better at it over time. Until 2013, it was just something I did for fun. In 2013, I wanted to work, and I wanted to become a web designer but I couldn't find a work for myself in that path, so I ended up working as a software developer. However, I still enjoy thinking about user interface and experience design.</p>
          <p>In my first job, I mostly wrote CoffeeScript code. Then, in my later jobs, I moved back to writing plain JavaScript. In the recent years, I sometimes needed to write TypeScript. I like them all *Scripts. But I <em>love</em> the CSS. There's not a technical reason why I love CSS over all other types of code. I think it's rather because I spent so much time writing CSS for fun when I was a teenager.</p>
          <p>Shortly after I started my first job, I discovered that merely writing code won't help making enough money. So, I started reading and learning about topics like git, software design patterns, clean code authorship practices, algorithms and data structures, databases, accessibility, performance, security, color theory, interaction design, various frameworks etc. It was and is a nice journey exploring all these topics and more.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'm an enthusiast of a text editor, that's used by many people to write code, called Vim. It has this nice good-old-days vibe going on compared to other popular text editors, I like it. In fact, I'm writing these lines in Vim.</p>

              <li>I showcase my creative coding works at my <a href="https://codepen.io/pavlovsk" target="_blank">CodePen profile</a>.</li>
              <li>I've created quite a few open source software projects. You can check them at my <a href="https://github.com/scriptype" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a>.</li>
              <li>Occasionally I create presentations related to software development. Feel free to give them a look at my <a href="https://slides.com/mustastum" target="_blank">Slides profile</a>.</li>
